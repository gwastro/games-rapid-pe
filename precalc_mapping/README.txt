Example of creating the pre-generated data for the prior volume. 

1) generation of a template bank that tiles the prior volume of interest
   See e.g bank.sh and bank.ini

2) Pre-calculation of how the prior volume maps to each template
   See e.g. map.py and map.sh. Although not required, we use the
   sampe priors defined in bank.ini as the overall priors of the space.
